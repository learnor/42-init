# $? is a built-in variable that stores the exit status of a command, function, or the script itself.
 
# $? reads the exit status of the last command executed. 
# After a function returns, $? gives the exit status of the last command executed in the function.
# This is Bash's way of giving functions a "return value."
# It returns 0 on success or an integer in the range 1 - 255 on error.
